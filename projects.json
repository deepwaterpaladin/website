            "A one-time-pad is a type of encryption that is used to hide the contents of a message. Each letter in the encrypted phrase has a corresponding 'one-time-pad' number.",
            "This number is then used to decrypt the message. Each one-time-pad number is a random number, and thus is impossible to guess and is theoretically impossible to crack by brute force. One-time-pads are used to hide messages in email, chat, and other online communication.",
            "The sample application uses TKinter for a simplified GUI. Source code can be found <a href='https://github.com/deepwaterpaladin/encryption_application', target='_blank'>here</a>."
